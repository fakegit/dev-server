nebula.bythewood.me
===================

Script to get my development server up and running. This probably shouldn't be
used by anyone else without heavy modification.


Getting Started
---------------

This pulls the latest from GitHub on a fresh system and then runs setup::

    curl "https://raw.github.com/overshard/nebula.bythewood.me/master/bootstrap.sh" | sh

If you already have the repo pulled you can run::

    ./setup.sh
