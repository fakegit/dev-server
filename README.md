# server-init

A simple script to get my dev server up and running, cfengine, puppet and chef
are all too complex for my needs and require me to install packages that I won't
later use. This is as minimal as it gets.

## Run this on the server...

    curl "https://raw.github.com/overshard/server-init/master/server-init.sh" | sh
